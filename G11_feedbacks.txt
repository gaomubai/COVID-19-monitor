Pair Programming (10/15 marks):
The pair-programming process is briefly explained in the Readme file, but no reflections were included.
It would be better to include more clear commit messages for pair programming. It is a bit hard to tell from commit history which commits were pair-programmed.


Program design (12/20 marks)
The program design is good in general.
Did not talk about application design at all in the readme file.


Functionality (17/25 marks)
File upload worked, but the query always returns errors ("Not Found").


Tests (20/20 marks)
Very good test coverage (above 90%).


Code Craftsmanship (6/10 marks)
Code style looks good in general, but barely any comments were provided in the code.
Did not mention tools/IDE used in the project.


README.md explanation and organization (8/10 marks): 
The Readme file included some instructions on how to run the application.


Total: 10 + 12 + 17 + 20 + 6 + 8 = 73
Final Mark: 15 * 73% = 10.95
